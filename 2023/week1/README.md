# Tidy Tuesday
Repo for Tidy Tuesday exercise, Week 1 (2023).

Bring your own data!

## Notes  

Some highlights:

* Used `geom_segment()` and `coord_polar()` to build a circular plot of Myles' sleep/wake times from his first few months
* Used `patchwork::` and Albert Rapp's [tutorial](https://albert-rapp.de/posts/ggplot2-tips/10_recreating_swd_look/10_recreating_swd_look.html) to have a text-only ggplot object used by `patchwork::`


## Future ideas

* Plan to get more data from Huckleberry, so I'd like to update it then.
