## Notes  


Some highlights:

## Future ideas

* It would be interesting to track appropriations over time as compared with annual visitors. Are there parks that are much more or less costly per visitor?
* Given the different unit_type options for parks, it could be neat to do a landing page for each type (with bump charts of rankings, visitor growth, etc.
* This project could be a neat exercise in adding the symbols of the services, pictures from Wikipedia, or other info from Wikipedia.
* I'd be interested in doing an analysis of accidents / deaths at NPS sites. [This](https://www.psbr.law/nevada/deaths-in-us-national-parks/) analysis was already done, and I do like the way they've analyzed and visualized the data. Maybe there's an extension or replication that I can do of this?
* A project on [deferred maintenance costs](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/infrastructure/maintenance-backlog.htm) could be really interesting.
