## Notes  


Some highlights:

## Future ideas

* It would be interesting to track appropriations over time as compared with annual visitors. Are there parks that are much more or less costly per visitor?
* Given the different unit_type options for parks, it could be neat to do a landing page for each type (with bump charts of rankings, visitor growth, etc.
* This project could be a neat exercise in adding the symbols of the services, pictures from Wikipedia, or other info from Wikipedia.
* I think I've heard of a dataset on accidents at national parks. That could be cool to find and generate of accident rates per 1,000 visitors.
