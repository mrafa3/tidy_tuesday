## Notes  

Some highlights:

*  Scraped Wikipedia to gather party of state governors. 

Further development:  

*  I could use `gt::` to build nice tables.  
*  I could use `geofacet::` like some of the examples that I like.

## Examples that I like 

*  [This](https://twitter.com/MaiaPelletier/status/1306648607790182403?s=19) is a nice use of `geofacet::` and I like the aesthetic.  
*  [This](https://twitter.com/kustav_sen/status/1306260316859150339?s=19) is another use of `geofacet::` that also incorporates the trend of data.
