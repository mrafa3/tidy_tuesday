## Notes  

Some highlights:

*  Experimented with `ggridges::` for a ridgeplots.  
*  Continued use of `jkmisc::` to allow for Markdown language in the visualization title, so that I don't have a traditional legend box on the plot.  
*  Using `geom_smooth()` to show relationship broken down by `species`.  
*  Using `ggtern::` to have a ternary diagram of penguin features.
