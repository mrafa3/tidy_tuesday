## Notes  

To-do:  

- [ ] There are some speeches among the `song_name` variable.  
- [ ] Did not stem the words, so the content analysis could be cleaner.  
- [ ] Using the `theme_jk(dark = TRUE)` argument, and I have gotten this to exactly match the color of the background.

Some highlights:

Further development:  

*  Could do sentiment analysis
*  Could predict the artist by the lyrics  
*  Could do a word cloud by sentiment
